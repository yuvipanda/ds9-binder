[SAOImage DS9](http://ds9.si.edu) is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application. It is a desktop
application, but widely used in the astronomy community.

This repository is a demo of using [jupyter-desktop](https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyter-desktop)
to run ds9 in your browser with no installation. This can easily be run in your own institutional
JupyterHub as well.
